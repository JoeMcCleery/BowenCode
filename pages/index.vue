                Celebrated Wine Maker Robert Bowen's  simplified approach to wine collection and management.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the Bowen Code, Robert Bowen has managed to distill 45 years of wine making and collecting knowledge in a system that anyone can understand and use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Robert Bowen's proven rating system presented as carefully considered combination of colour and alphanumeric tags allows you to gain overview of the status of your wine collection at a single glance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Robert has made the Bowen Code freely* available to the wine collecting public as his contribution to supporting the education and enjoyment of wine.

              <p>
                Shifting from being simply a consumer of wine to a collector can be very rewarding. The challenge is how to get started.

              <p>
                Within this site Rob provides access to a range or industry backed resources and people that can start you on the journey of wine collection.
              </p>
              <p>
                From cost effective racking, online education services and of course the Bowen Code approach to wine collecting.

              <p>
                There is one golden rule when starting a cellar. "Buy more wine than you drink"
