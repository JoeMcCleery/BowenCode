                Celebrated Wine Maker Robert Bowen's  simplified approach to wine collection and management.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the Bowen Code, Robert Bowen has managed to distill 45 years of wine making and collecting knowledge in a system that anyone can understand and use.
              </p>
              <p>
                Robert Bowen's proven rating system presented as carefully considered combination of colour and alphanumeric tags allows you to gain overview of the status of your wine collection at a single glance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Robert has made the Bowen Code freely* available to the wine collecting public as his contribution to supporting the education and enjoyment of wine.
